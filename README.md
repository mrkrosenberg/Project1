### Main Title: Rick and Morty's ClickBait Adventure

Project 1 : A two player, vs. style game. Can be played by up to 2 human players.
I wanted my game to be something that would be fun, but also have a theme. On top of that, I wanted to do something that would stray from what you would expect from a game. After more than a few revisions, I landed on the idea of playing a Rick and Morty themed joke on the lucky person(s) who decided to give this game a try. 

## Objectives
Player 1 : 
          Move around the screen to chase a moving target
          
Player 2 : 
          Move around the screen to chase a moving target
          
Scoring :
          Each time player catches the target, 1pt is awarded

Portal :
          Portals will move around the screen and move the player when they collide
          
How to Win: 
          Winning is a matter of being "smarter" than the system. Just click the space bar to win.
